## 1. Preparing

Before you can begin connecting your accounts, you must first log into your Cactusian account and navigate to the [Connections Settings](https://cactusian.com/settings#/connections) page. This page shows you all the external accounts you can connect.

## 2. Connecting

1. Firstly, choose the option to connect Roblox from the page. You will be redirected to the official Roblox site. If you are not already logged in on the Roblox site, you will be asked to login.
2. Roblox will now ask you to make sure that you are logged into the correct Roblox account for this procedure. If you are, press to continue, but if you are not, press to change the account.
