To change your profile settings, you need to be logged into your Cactusian account and navigate to the [Profile Settings](https://cactusian.com/settings#/profile) page.

## 1. Profile Name

Your profile name is the name you want others to recognize and address you by. It can be your real first name, a shortened version of it, or a unique online nickname that reflects your identity. It has a 20 characters limit, but unlike the username, the profile name is not unique (meaning multiple users can have the same profile name at the same time.

## 2. Profile Picture

The profile picture is a circular image that is usually displayed near your profile name and username. It can be anything you wish, like your pet, some cool image you took or just something random and unexpected.

The image you upload will be cut into a circle, so if it contains any important details in the corners, please keep in mind that they may not be visible.

## 3. About Me

The about me is a large section of text that lets you freely describe yourself. You can put anything there like your hobbies, the games you play, beloved singers, favorite foods and so much more. It's still important to keep some privacy though, so don't share personal information that you don't want strangers to know.

You can configure who can see your about me on the [Privacy Settings](https://cactusian.com/settings#/privacy) page.

## 4. Location

The location gives you the option to share the place where you live with the people visiting your profile. **Do not provide your exact address or neighborhood.** Anything more precise than your city/town is not recommended.

You can configure who can see your location on the [Privacy Settings](https://cactusian.com/settings#/privacy) page.

## 5. Next Steps

Now that your profile has been updated, you can share it with your friends and other people you want to see it. You should also take a moment to discover other people's profiles and see what they made them like.
