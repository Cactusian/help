## 1. Visit Sign Up Page

The first step is visiting the [Sign Up](https://cactusian.com/sign-up) page on the Cactusian site. Once you are there, you will be asked to enter your birthday, pick a unique username (it has to be 20 characters or less) and enter your email address. When you have completed this step, press the button to continue.

## 2. Email Verification

You will need to verify your email address in order to active your account and be able to use it. You will receive an email from Cactusian to the address you have provided earlier to us. Follow the instructions in that email to active your account.

## 3. Next Steps

After you have activated your account by verifying your email address, you are now able to freely use your newly created Cactusian account. You can learn more about what you can do with it and explore Cactusian's endless universe.
