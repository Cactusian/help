## 1. Login Requests

Each time you or someone else attempts to log into your Cactusian account, you'll receive an email prompting you to verify and authorize the device.

Always exercise caution when you receive these emails. Carefully review the device details provided, such as the type, model, and location, to ensure the login attempt is legitimate. **Never verify login requests that were not made by you.**

It's important to note that if you share your email account with somebody else (like a friend or a family member), they can gain access to your Cactusian account anytime, without your approval, as they can verify the login request by themselves.

## 2. Sharing Confidential Information

Never share sensitive or confidential account information with anyone, including close friends or those claiming to represent Cactusian. Our team will never request such details from you.

Additionally, if you are being asked by somebody to run a certrain script/command in your browser or to share a cookie, 11/10 times it's a scam. Cookies store critical information that authenticates your device for account access and sharing them with someone else grants them full access to your account.

## 3. Malicious Programs & Extensions

To protect your account, avoid downloading, installing, or activating software, applications, or browser extensions from unverified or untrusted sources. These sources may include unofficial websites, third-party app stores, or links shared through unsolicited emails or messages. Untrusted sources can distribute viruses, ransomware, or spyware, which may compromise your security, steal sensitive data, or cause other kinds of damages.
